# 1. Fallback
![](writeups/ethernaut/fallback/contract.png)

## What is a fallback function?
-   [Special functions solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#special-functions)
-   `receive()`Â function Solidity
-   enables a smart contractâ€™s inherent ability to act like aÂ wallet, this way other contracts/wallets can send Ether to the contract without having to know theÂ `ABI`Â or specific function names
-   without a fallback, or known payable functions, smart contracts can only receive Ether
-   how to trigger the fallback functions
	-   calling a function that doesn't exist
	-   calling a function without passing the required data
	-   sending Ether without any data to the contract
-   a contract's fallback is always nameless

## Dissecting The Contract
-   the contractÂ `owner`Â will be assigned to whomever creates the contract:Â `constructor() { owner = msg.sender }`
-   `modifier onlyOwner`Â used to ensure that only theÂ `owner`Â can execute some functionsÂ _(e.gÂ `withdraw`)_
-   `withdraw`Â will transfer the entire balance of the contract to its owner
-   upon creationÂ _(inÂ `constructor()`)_Â the owner is assigned a total ofÂ `1000`Â ether:Â `contributions[msg.sender] = 1000 * (1 ether)`
-   `contribute()`
-   we can make a contribution by
-   finally the fallback:Â `receive()`

## Takeaways
-   when implementing a fallback function, keep it simple
-   use fallback functions to:
    -   emit payment events to the tx log
    -   check simple conditional requirements
-   think twice before using fallback functions, especially if you plan to change the contract's ownership, transfer funds or support low-level function callso
