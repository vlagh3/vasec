- One of the users wanted to exploit a domain controller with an MS-NRPC based exploit. What is the filename of the archive that you found? *(include the spaces in your answer)*
	- @ first I thought that the suspicious `kill the memory/kill.py` script in sivapriya's desktop has anything to do with it, but I didn't find anything useful so I started looking elsewhere
	- with a quick google search on `MS-NRPC based exploit` we find that the exploit is [ZeroLogon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/) => so I did a keyword search for it & found this archive
