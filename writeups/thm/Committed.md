# Committed

- since we're given access to the machine I got `commited.zip`  through python's http server: 
	- ubuntu: `python -m http.server` 
	- my machine: `wget http://ip-addr/commited.zip`
- once we `unzip commited.zip` we get 2 files

- no credential leaks here, but we see that a `.git` dir is present => we can see the git commit log
	 - ![[Pasted image 20220720032834.png]]
	 - or by manually looking in the dir

	 > **NOTE**: by default `git log` only shows us commits from the `master` branch while the other gives us all the commits from all branches *(i.e `dbint`)*. However we can see the full commit log with the `--reflog` 
	 - the commit that catched my eye was the one with the msh `Oops`
- but how can we see the commit changes from past branches? well with `git log -p -<line_nr>` *(have a look @ the manual page `git log --help`)* or with `git show <commit-id>`
