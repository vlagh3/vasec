# History of Malware - THM

- Concepts of Malicious Software have been around since **1949**, and one of the first known theories was created by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) who produced work detailing self-replicating computer programs
	- he also devised the von Neumann architecture *(how computers transfer data to hardware)*
- Proven 22 years later *(1971)* by the **Creeper** worm which used [ARPANET]() to transfer itself between computers only displaying `"I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"`
	- technically it wasn't malware, in that it didn't produce any harm too the computers it visited, but still a POC
- **ARPANET**: originally started out with two specific protocols - remote login & file transfers
	- this was the start of computers being able to communicate within networks
	- packet switching is used to acomplish this by breaking data into packets to then route/send said data to the receiver *(which will reassemble the packets back into data being sent)*
	- ![[Pasted image 20220701024850.png]]
- **Wabbit**: self-replicating malware that would work so fast it drained up all of its resources & end up crashing
	- was only able to infect the machine it was put on and did **not** pass via a network, hence why it is not classed as a _worm_
	- it was being a form of denial-of-service known as a [**fork-bomb**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb)
	- creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file, creating a high number of _CPU cycles_ *(the time for the execution of one process)* which "constipates" the system and consumes operating system resources, causing it to get slower until its eventual crash
- **ANIMAL**: the first [[trojan]], created by John Walter, would act as a game and ask the user a number of questions to guess the type of animal they were thinking of. Whilst the user played the "fun" game, another program, or subroutine, called "PERVADE" would create a copy of itself and _ANIMAL_ in every directory that the user has access toA *(more about it [here](https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/animal.html))*
- **Elk Cloner**: one of the first _microcomputer viruses_ *(1982)* that spread outside of a computer system or laboratory *(i.e in the wild)*
	- written by a 15 year-old _high school student_ known for his pranks and practical jokes
	- used a technique now called _"boot sector virus"_
	- The program was placed into a game's code until an unsuspecting victim started the game for the 50th time. Instead of lunching the game it would display the following poem:
		```
		Elk Cloner: The program with a personality  
		it will get on all your disks  
		it will infiltrate your chips  
		Yes, it's Cloner!  
		It will stick to you like glue  
		It will modify RAM too  
		Send in the Cloner!  
		```
	- If the computer booted from an _infected_ floppy disk, a copy of the virus was placed in the computer's memory, this then spread to _uninfected_ discs that were inserted into infected computers. Elk Cloner also wrote a _signature byte_ to the disk's directory, indicating that it had already been infected
	- **Boot Sector Viruses**: are less common in modern technology, but still are relevant and important to know about. They usually infect the boot sector (the part which starts the computer) and once infected, they will try to infect every disc inserted into the infected computer but can be removed. The computer does not have to successfully boot in order for the computer to become infected. (you will only see this with floppy discs)
- **The Morris Internet Worm**: released in **1988**, **Robert Tappan Morris** created a worm that was supposed to highlight security flaws of the academic networks that it travelled to
	- only downfall of the worm was that it failed to check which computers it had already been to, thus infecting many computers multiple times and causing a DoS attack
	- Morris was the first person to be arrested from a felony conviction in the US under the 1986 [Computer Fraud and Abuse act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_2018)
	- the worm spread simply by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Unix Sendmail, rsh (remote shell)/[rexec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) and weak passwords
	- it infected 2000 computers in 15h & it often took 2 days to get it off a computer, rendering it useless. 6000  computers were infected in the end and this was around 10% of the internet at the time
	- although it caused a lot of damage it raised awareness of the dangers of weak passwords
- **Cascade**: DOS malware, notably the first type to use a form of encryption to keep the program undetected
	- in the 80s, specifically on the **Digital Equipment** *(a large computer company)* operating systems, a common file extension for executables was `.COM` *(similar to how a batch file/`.sh` file would work now)* which allowed text files containing commands to be executable
	- the virus would only work by executing the infected file. Each time the infected file was run, it would slowly make changes to the computer
	- the virus would try not to infect [IBM Computers](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en) by looking for text containing a copyright statement. However, this failed due to a bug which allowed it to infect all computers
	- was truly a big virus, some accounts claiming there were 40 different variants
