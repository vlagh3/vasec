# AD -- Objects

Objects are part of the logical structure of AD. Their main purpose is to help the sys-admin with the management of network resources. For this, the AD allows the admin to register resources in the form of **directory objects**.

Each object type/class corresponds to an administered resource type:
- Users
- Shared Folders
- User Groups
- [[AD -- Organizational Units (OU)|Organizational Units]]
- Computers
- Printers
- Contacts

Every object is an instance of a [class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc785254(v=ws.10)) defined in the [schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc739086(v=ws.10))
