![[Pasted image 20220618185541.png]]

- **Domain**: is a naming for a resource family. The [domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc780856(v=ws.10)) is the main functional unit of the logical structure of AD
- **Tree**: this is a hierarchical organization of one or more Domains. All domains share information and resources in the tree, where roles are unique
- **Forest**: is a set of trees. The use of [forests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc738670(v=ws.10)) is quite common in groups of companies, where each of the companies in the group maintains an identity autonomy in relation to the others
