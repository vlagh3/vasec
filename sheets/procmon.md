# Procmon *(Process Monitor)*

> "Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such as session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit."


- to use ProcMon effectively you **must** use the Filter and **must** configure it properly
- [Here](https://adamtheautomator.com/procmon/) is a useful guide on configuring ProcMon

> **Note**:  To fully understand the output from some of these tools you need to understand some Windows concepts, such as [Processes and Threads](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/about-processes-and-threads) and [Windows API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list) calls.
