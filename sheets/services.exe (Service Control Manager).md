# `services.exe` (Service Control Manager)
- spawned by `wininit.exe`
- primary responsibility is to handle system services: loading services, interacting with services, starting/ending services, etc
- maintains a db, accesible through the `sc.exe` cmd
- info regarding services is stored in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services`
- also loads device drivers marked as auto-start into memory
- when user logs into a machine, this proc is responsible for setting the value of the `Last Known Good` control set, in `HKLM\System\Select\LastKnownGood`, to that of the `CurrentControlSet`
- is the parent of severaal other key procs *(e.g `svchost.exe`, `spoolsv.exe`, `msmpeng.exe`, `dllhost.exe`)*
